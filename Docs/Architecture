Interactions
Data Flow
Data Collection: Raw data is collected and stored in the Data/Raw directory.
Data Processing: Data is processed, encrypted, and moved to the Data/Encrypted directory.
Data Analysis: Encrypted data is analyzed by AI models stored in the Data/Models directory.
Threat Detection: AI detects threats and initiates key rotation if necessary.
Logging: All actions are logged in the Data/Logs directory.
Backup: Data is periodically backed up to the Data/Backups directory.
Security Measures
Layered Encryption: Multiple layers of encryption ensure data security.
Key Management: Keys are managed and rotated regularly.
AI Monitoring: AI constantly monitors data for threats and anomalies.
Automated Response: Upon detecting a threat, the system automatically rotates keys and re-encrypts data.
Conclusion
The Cyber_Ai_Security_Suite is a robust, AI-driven security solution that provides comprehensive protection through advanced encryption techniques and proactive threat detection. This architecture document provides an overview of its components and their interactions, ensuring clarity and facilitating maintenance and future development.
